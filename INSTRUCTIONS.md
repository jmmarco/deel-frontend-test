Frontend test
Part 1 (up to 75 minutes)
Please prepare an auto-complete component in React.
* You cannot use any 3rd party libraries - only pure React and internal DOM
functions.
* The function to filter the data should be asynchronous. You can use mock
data (such as a JSON array), but the function which uses it should be
asynchronous (similar to a real REST call).
* It should have basic working CSS. No need for anything fancy (such as
drop-shadows etc), but should look decent.
* You need to handle all non-standard/edge use-cases - it should have a
perfect user-experience.
* Bonus points if you highlight the matching part of the text and not only
showing it.
* Prefer using plain JS, not TS
* No external state management libraries (refer to #1 as well), only native React method.
* Use only class components, feel free to use life-cycle methods if you need.
* Shortcuts and hacks are perfectly ok - BUT you have to add comments on what are you doing there and why. You should either write production ready code or include comments on what needs to be changed for
production.
* Add a README.md file explaining how to run the project.
* Bonus #1 now implement also as functional component with hooks.
* Bonus #2 load data using a read API call to some resource.
